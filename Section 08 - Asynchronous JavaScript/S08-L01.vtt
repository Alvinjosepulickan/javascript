<v ->In this section, we're gonna talk</v>

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.360
about asynchronous JavaScript,

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.806
which basically is just a fancy term

4
00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.840
for some code that keeps running in the background

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.670
while our main code is still executing.

6
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.490
And typically, that is for stuff like requesting some data

7
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.270
from a remote server, like an API.

8
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.281
So in this section, I'm gonna give you the tools

9
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:24.490
to work with asynchronous JavaScript in a very modern way

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.680
because it actually works quite differently

11
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.480
from what we've been doing up until this point.

12
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.020
So let's now quickly move on.

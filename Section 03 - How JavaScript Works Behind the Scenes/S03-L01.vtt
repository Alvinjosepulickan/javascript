00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.550
<v ->Hello and welcome to the section</v>

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.400
about how JavaScript actually works behind the scenes.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.330
So now that you have a basic knowledge about the language,

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.370
Let's take our skills to the next levels and take a look

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.540
behind the scenes of JavaScript.

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.320
And this is the part that many JavaScript courses out there

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.050
simply skip or just mention very briefly

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.060
and that's actually, really a problem,

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.880
because this stuff is something

10
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.680
that you really need to learn.

11
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.390
Because if you truly understand

12
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.950
how the language works, well then you're going to be able

13
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.910
to write better code, to debug your code,

14
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.870
and to better understand other developer's code.

15
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.930
And toward the end, everything that you're gonna learn

16
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.570
in this section will really make you a better

17
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.620
JavaScript developer.

18
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.210
Now, these lectures are a mix of theory lectures

19
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.000
and coding examples and so you'll actually immediately

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.050
practice what you learn here.

21
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.860
And if something feels a bit overwhelming,

22
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.820
well then don't worry, you can always rewatch a lecture

23
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.780
or also come back to it later.

24
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.130
So, are you ready?

25
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.280
Then let's get started.

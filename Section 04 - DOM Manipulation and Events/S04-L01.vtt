00:00:01.547 --> 00:00:05.259
<v ->This section is about DOM manipulation with JavaScript.</v>

2
00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.330
So up until this point,

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.930
we have only talked about the language itself,

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.381
but never about how we can actually use JavaScript

5
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:14.844
in the browser to make it interact with the webpage.

6
00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:16.518
And that's why, in this section,

7
00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:19.915
we're gonna build our very first small project together.

8
00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:22.477
And this project is a very simple but fun game

9
00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:24.742
that we can play in our browser.

10
00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:27.700
So it's basically just a HTML webpage that is gonna track

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.077
with the JavaScript code that we'll be writing.

12
00:00:31.077 --> 00:00:33.609
So, you will learn a ton of new stuff,

13
00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.776
and of course, you will also use some

14
00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:38.285
of the concepts that you've learned so far.

15
00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:41.206
So let's go have some fun with this project now!

16
00:00:41.206 --> 00:00:43.873
(playful music)

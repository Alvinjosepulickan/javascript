00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.779
<v ->Hello, and welcome back to the next section.</v>

2
00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:05.137
Let's now take a deep dive

3
00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:07.500
into the most advanced topics in JavaScript.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.144
And that is Objects and Functions.

5
00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:12.792
So Objects and Functions are two closely related

6
00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:14.500
concepts in JavaScript.

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.475
They are also the two most used features of the language

8
00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.393
because they allow us to do so many advanced things

9
00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:21.689
with our code.

10
00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.576
And so it's absolutely vital that you get a good grasp

11
00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:27.954
of everything about Objects and Functions.

12
00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.333
Now some of these concepts may be kind of difficult

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.683
to understand and confusing in the beginning.

14
00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:33.638
Alright?

15
00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:34.512
But don't worry.

16
00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:36.347
That's absolutely normal when you're first

17
00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:38.125
confronted with these topics.

18
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.590
So just pay good attention, take some notes,

19
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.302
and maybe re-watch a lecture or two,

20
00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:43.732
if that's necessary.

21
00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:44.725
And if you do so,

22
00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:47.205
well I can guarantee you that Objects and Functions

23
00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:49.198
will be crystal clear after this section.

24
00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:51.644
And, with that being said, let's now get started

25
00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:54.135
with a deep dive into Objects.

26
00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:57.552

<v ->Hey there and welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.680
So after our big project in the last section,

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.020
we will now actually move from the ES5 JavaScript version

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.303
to the ES6 or even newer for the rest of the course.

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.240
So remember that we talked briefly about JavaScript versions

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.070
right in the beginning of the course.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.270
And so from now on, it's time to really dive deep

8
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.970
into next generation JavaScript.

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.830
And don't forget that everything that you learned

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.540
up until this point is, of course, still valid

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.200
and still very important.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.280
Because all that really changes is a bit of syntax

13
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.920
and some new features.

14
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.380
But not really how the language works, okay?

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.420
So in this section you will learn what's new in ES6

16
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.730
so that in the next section, we can then create

17
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.875
a new, huge project using modern JavaScript.

18
00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.375

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.860
<v ->Welcome to the second project of the course.</v>

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.690
This is where everything that we've learned

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.630
up until this point comes together

4
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.670
and you will even learn a ton of new

5
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.400
JavaScript features doing this project.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.470
So we're gonna use all this advanced content

7
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.350
about object and functions.

8
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.940
Lots of arrays, lots of dot manipulation

9
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.800
and a bunch of other important stuff.

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.600
Now this project is not just about coding,

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620
it's also about how to approach

12
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.800
and how to solve specific problems.

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700
So basically, it's also about how to think

14
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.170
as a JavaScript programmer

15
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.810
and so we'll be talking a lot about

16
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.200
structuring our code.

17
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.410
Why we take certain decisions about objects

18
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.660
or funky creations and so on and so forth.

19
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.600
Because coding is not just writing

20
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.230
a bunch of lines of code,

21
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.180
but it's also about how to think

22
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.800
and how to make all the pieces of a code fit together.

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.600
So that in the end we have a final, functioning product.

24
00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:58.856
(soft tribal beat)
